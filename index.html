So what is Kaspa? Or Bitcoin?
Ask yourself What is a block-chain? And how does Bitcoin work?
Most of you guys probably don't know that because you are either new to blockchain.
or gamblers, who want to make a quick buck without having a clue what you are investing in.
Imagine a block
</pre>

            <pre class="Homepagepara">
Now imagine that each of these blocks have a list of transactions.
One transaction is from you to the cafe, for coffee.
Another is from you to a friend to pay back for some chips.
Now miners need to verify these transactions with their computers.
Why? Because there are bad people with bad intentions, who want to hack the network and create/steal coins.
How do they verify the transactions?
First, miners go through every transaction and investigate that each is legitimate and no wrongdoing has occurred.
After that, the miner must find the hash.
What is a hash, you ask?
This is a hash.
</pre>
            <a href="" style="text-decoration: none; color: var(--light);" title="Find out what this says!" target="_blank">
                <h3 class="hash">527f2eba74ce61200d67fb598e0d9671d9b7b77da4ab8478438a61c283f82306</h3>
            </a>

            <pre class="Homepagepara">
It’s a unique code that represents the block’s data.
You yourself can use a SHA-256 calculator such as <a href="https://10015.io/tools/sha256-encrypt-decrypt"
target="_blank" style="outline: none; ">this.</a>
Now we will dive into what SHA-256 is on the Bitcoin page later on but I will provide you a few examples of
SHA-256.
For example, let's type in the word 'Hi' (Every symbol including space bars can change the code completely).
</pre>


            <h3 class="hash">3639efcd08abb273b1619e82e78c29a7df02c1051b1820e99fc395dcaa3326b8</h3>






            <pre class="Homepagepara">
Now let's try 'Hi '
Make sure you include the white space.
</pre>

            <h3 class="hash">c9e6290e09f45a7432b78addc3e5a458ac72a96d76f7010f1fd25701f629180b</h3>

            <pre class="Homepagepara">
See the difference that even a simple space can change the entire hash.
Every small detail can create a unique hash!
You can use this <a href="https://10015.io/tools/sha256-encrypt-decrypt" target = "_blank">Decrypter</a> to reverse the hash (Note: long ones will take time!).
Now miners will take
</pre>

            <pre class="Homepagepara">
If even a single detail in the block changes, the hash will change completely.
Why is finding the hash hard?
Miners have to guess the correct hash by solving a complex mathematical puzzle.
This process is called Proof of Work. It requires a lot of computational power and energy,
but it’s necessary to keep the blockchain secure.
Once a miner finds the correct hash, they shout, “I found it!” to the network.
Other miners then verify the hash and, if it’s correct, the block is added to the blockchain.

After adding the block, the miner that found the correct hash is rewarded with cryptocurrency.
</pre>

            <pre class="Homepagepara">
Now after we found the hash for the block, we start the process allllll over again.
</pre>

            <pre class="Homepagepara">
Now for bitcoin, they aim to verify the entire blocks, which is aimed to take 10 minutes.
10 minutes to verify? Imagine spending 10 minutes waiting at the shops!
(This does not even include if the block is full and your transaction is in the next block, which could take an hour!)
Some pro Bitcoiners will tell you about something called the Lightning Network,
which makes Bitcoin super fast! (Which is true)
However, what they won't tell you is that it is very centralized, meaning
they can at any time shut down the network! Not very Bitcoin-like, right?
